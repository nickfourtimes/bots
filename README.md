# BOTS

Where I make & manage my little butts.

I started off of [this](https://philna.sh/blog/2023/05/01/build-bots-on-bluesky-with-typescript/) guide, which got me into BlueSky bots, with the added info on how to [schedule](https://philna.sh/blog/2023/05/01/build-bots-on-bluesky-with-typescript/#scheduling-with-github-actions) things with GH Actions.
